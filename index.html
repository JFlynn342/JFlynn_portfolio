    Hello!
</h1>
<h2>
    Welcome to my dev blog. Over the next few months, I will be describing my process as I develop a real-time
    animation system in C++!
</h2>
<p>
    5/22/23: Just finished the planning phase. Everything feels nice and doable.
    Hopefully two weeks for Bezier curves is enough, that feels like it could be a bit
    daunting at first.

    5/27/23: Been having trouble setting up dependencies for the past two weeks and I finally figured out what should be the
    last hurdle: I need to roll back my Windows SDK version in order for it to work with the framework I'm using.
</p>
<p>
    5/29/23: I DID IT!!! WinRT is not an easy beast, but I finally figured out how to set up the dependencies properly (SDK rollback was not the solution, but better package management was). 
</p>
<p>
    5/31/23: This past week was a deep dive into Visual Studio dependency management for me. I figured out how to share include files across multiple projects, 
    as well as how to manage some of the native Windows libraries. Because of this, I was able to set up my project as an adjacent directory so that my code is not directly
    comingled with the rendering framework code. Now that I have the project building, my next objective is to switch out animations instantaneously (step interpolation), which means
    creating a mechanism to define a "Transition", as well as a way to run it.
