    Hello!
</h1>
<h2>
    Welcome to my dev blog. Over the next few months, I will be describing my process as I develop a real-time
    animation system in C++!
</h2>
<p>
    5/22/23: Just finished the planning phase. Everything feels nice and doable.
    Hopefully two weeks for Bezier curves is enough, that feels like it could be a bit
    daunting at first.
</p>
<p>
    5/27/23: Been having trouble setting up dependencies for the past two weeks and I finally figured out what should be the
    last hurdle: I need to roll back my Windows SDK version in order for it to work with the framework I'm using.
</p>
<p>
    5/29/23: I DID IT!!! WinRT is not an easy beast, but I finally figured out how to set up the dependencies properly (SDK rollback was not the solution, but better package management was). 
</p>
<p>
    5/31/23: This past week was a deep dive into Visual Studio dependency management for me. I figured out how to share include files across multiple projects, 
    as well as how to manage some of the native Windows libraries. Because of this, I was able to set up my project as an adjacent directory so that my code is not directly
    comingled with the rendering framework code. Now that I have the project building, my next objective is to switch out animations instantaneously (step interpolation), which means
    creating a mechanism to define a "Transition", as well as a way to run it.
</p>
<p>
    6/8/2023: I can toggle between animations with the step transition now! The Transition abstract base class I created implements functionality for "linking" two animations, and I made sure to have the execution
    return a boolean if it runs so that I can ensure that only one transition at most can execute on each update frame. The StepTransition derived class extends the base functionality by adding an implementation of Run() 
    which swaps out the origin pose for the target pose on the active animation player. However, linear transitions are still a bit rough. Whenever I try to alter the bone transforms to blend between the original
    transforms and those at the target frame on the other clip, the model geometry explodes. I have two suspicions on this: I am either using a bad interpolation formula 
    (currently origin + ((target - origin) * alpha) where alpha = deltaTime/duration, performed on all floats in the transform matrix), or I'm not projecting the coordinates properly after the values
    are changed.
