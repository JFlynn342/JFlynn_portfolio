Meowtations is a platformer I developed with a small team over the summer of 2020. Although it was never finished, 
it still serves as a strong testament to my Unity experience. As one of the two programmers on the team, I implemented
several of the game's key features, including the player's movement and the health icons that disappear when damage is taken.
The fact that enemy projectiles are fired at a height and rate that makes them essentially unavoidable was meant to be taken care of,
but the start of the fall semester required us to abandon the project in order to focus on coursework and other commitments.


Woods of Woe is a turn-based RPG that I created with a partner from scratch in C++ during the fall of 2020 as part of a game 
design class at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. During its development, I implemented all of the combat mechanics and systems. 
During the first five weeks of the course, we worked on building the "Dragonfly" engine that the game runs on, while the last 
two weeks were spent making the game itself.

Unfinished Business was a 2D platformer which was my senior year capstone project. I created it with four other students, only one of
which was also a programmer. My contributions included most of the combat mechanics, as well as the programming of the entire character 
controller from scratch (PlayerBase.cs).
