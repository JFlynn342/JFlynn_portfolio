Woods of Woe is a turn-based RPG that I created with a partner from scratch in C++ during the fall of 2020 as part of a game 
design class at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. During its development, I implemented all of the combat mechanics and systems. 
During the first five weeks of the course, we worked on building the "Dragonfly" engine that the game runs on, while the last 
two weeks were spent making the game itself.

Unfinished Business was a 2D platformer which was my senior year capstone project. I created it with four other students, only one of
which was also a programmer. My contributions included most of the combat mechanics, as well as the programming of the entire character 
controller from scratch (PlayerBase.cs).

The Fiea Game Engine is another custom game engine project that I worked on in UCF's Interactive Entertainment MS program. It differs from my undergraduate game engine project in that I both rewrote several standard library containers, including vector and unordered_map, and implemented support for data-driven scripting through a custom JSON parser.
